# Geographic tasks for finding weather at certain locations. (Python library geopy may be of good use here...)

# Collect locations that user would enter (e.g. "Philadelphia, PA", "Hanover, MD")

list_of_locations = ["Philadelphia, PA", "Hanover, MD", "Columbus, OH"] # Starting small, can be "drop-down"-selected, or better "entry-completed"

# Find geo-tags (lat-lon, gridpoints, zipcodes)
# Find the nearest Forecast Zone and/or (Observation) Station
